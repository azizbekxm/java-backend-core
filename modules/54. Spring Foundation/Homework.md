This document contains homework tasks for `Spring Foundation`.



Task 1 - Spring Configuration
==========================
Create Basic Spring application which will have Data Source configuration provided by spring Configuration (2 points):
* Introduce a configuration(using @Configuration) which should have a method annotated with @Bean which returns a configured data source instance.
* Use https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.h2database/h2 as a Data Source.
* Add test which tests your application by saving an entity to the data source(@DataJpaTest/@DataJdbcTest).

Task 2 - Conditional Configuration
==========================
Adjust existing configuration for Data Source based on conditional properties (2 points):
* Custom Data Source should be optionally enabled or disabled based on a configuration property (@ConditionalOnProperty).
* Enable the custom Data Source if the property is set to true or missing.
* (Optional) Disable the custom Data Source and discover which Auto Configuration is responsible for creating a default Data source.

Task 3 - Spring Profiles
==========================
Separate Data Source Configurations using Profiles (2 points):
* Create a configuration files for two environments (local, dev).
* Define database connection properties (url, username, password) in each file.
* Create additional configuration file for test profile (under /test/java/resources folder).
* Adjust test from the Task 1 to use Data Source configured from test configuration file(@DataJpaTest/@DataJdbcTest + @AutoConfigureTestDatabase(replace = NONE)).

Task 4 - Spring Actuator
==========================
* Enable actuator by adding https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot-starter-actuator dependency. (1 point)
* Expose Default Spring Actuator by configuring SecurityFilterChain/SecurityWebFilterChain bean. (1 point)
* Check OOTB actuator endpoints (using /actuator).
* Add a new custom actuator endpoint(using @Component and @Endpoint(id = ...)) to return active profile and current DB url. (2 points)
* Only 2 endpoints (/health and custom endpoint above) should be exposed. Apply these changes for both environments (local and dev) by using a base configuration file.
